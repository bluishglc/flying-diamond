# GAME: FLYING-DIAMOND

This project is developed in 2011, I wrote it for learning MVC pattern and Java Swing library.

It was stored on sourcegore.net, now I migrate it to Github.

You can run `mvn package` under project folder to build it, then double click `target\flyingdiamond-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` to run it.

Here is a snapshot of game gui:
